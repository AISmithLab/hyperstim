"""Alert issues (plan 013, decision 12): an hourly check that opens a GitHub issue when the
collector, or one of its jobs, hasn't worked for a day, comments when that changes or drags on,
and closes the issue when it works again.

The repo is public, so nothing but fixed text goes out: each title, body and comment is a
template below, and the only values filled in are typed slots (a time, a date, a count, or a
word from a fixed list). A value that doesn't match its slot's type is posted as "unknown".
Error messages, log lines, paths and addresses never reach a slot; the details stay on the
server (`status` and the log).
