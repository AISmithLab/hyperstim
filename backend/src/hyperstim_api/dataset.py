"""The video dataset, loaded into memory and ranked.

It is the reference set (`data/videos.tsv`, v2's 16,375 videos), which defines every
percentile and score, plus the videos the collector added since and minus the ones it took
out (plan 013). Added videos are scored against the reference set like live checks, so a
video's score never changes as the dataset grows. Removed videos stay in memory with the
time they were removed, so a list can be shown as it was at an earlier time (`as_of`).
