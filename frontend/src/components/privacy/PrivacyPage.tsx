              Our pages are hosted by GitHub Pages. Like any web host, GitHub receives your IP address and browser
              details, and logs which pages are requested. See <External href={GITHUB_PRIVACY}>GitHub’s privacy statement</External>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We log each request for scores and video details: your IP address, the time, the address requested, and
              your browser. We use these logs to keep the site running and safe from abuse, and delete them after 14
              days.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you accept when the site asks, we also use Google Analytics to count visits and see which pages are
              used. Google then receives your IP address, your browser and device, the pages you view, and the site
              that sent you here, and keeps this for 2 months. Google works for us as a service provider and may
              process the data in the US. We don’t use it for ads, and we’ve turned off sharing it with Google for
              other purposes. See <External href={GOOGLE_PRIVACY}>Google’s privacy policy</External>.

            <p>
              When you check a video that isn’t in our dataset, we download it from YouTube, measure it, and delete
              the download as soon as it’s done.
            </p>
            <p>
              We save the results, with the video’s ID, title and channel, so they’re ready for the next person who
              checks the same video. They aren’t linked to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you play a video, YouTube may set cookies in your browser. See{" "}

            <p>
              We set cookies only if you accept Google Analytics. It uses them to tell visits apart. They are kept for 2
              years, or until you change your choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your choice is saved in your browser for a year, so we don’t ask on every page. It never leaves your
              browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your browser sends Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track, we treat it as a no to Google Analytics and
              don’t ask.
