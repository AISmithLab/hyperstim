/**
 * A video's YouTube thumbnail with a "Play video" button; the click (the visitor's consent)
 * swaps in the youtube-nocookie.com player in the same box. Nothing loads from the player
 * domain before the click.
 *
 * With `onPlay`, the player also reports when it starts playing (also after a pause), and `ref`
 * can pause it, through the embed's message API; no script is loaded from YouTube. The compare
 * page uses this to play one video at a time.
 *
 * With `start` and `end` (seconds), it plays only that stretch: it starts there, stops at `end`, and
 * starts over from `start` when played again after it. With `onTime`, it reports the video's time
 * on every frame while playing (between YouTube's reports, about four a second, the time is
 * carried forward by the clock), and once when it pauses. A post's clip comparison uses both, and
 * `playFrom` for its lanes.
 *
 * With `captions={false}`, it turns YouTube's captions off when the video starts (some videos
 * show them by default). Only then: a viewer can still turn them back on with the CC button.
 *
 * With `onStart`, the parent owns the playing state instead: the click calls `onStart`, and
 * `playing` shows the player (the video page and the channel's video panel move it to a larger spot). With `cover`, the thumbnail
 * stays over the player until it has loaded, then fades out, so the box isn't black meanwhile.
