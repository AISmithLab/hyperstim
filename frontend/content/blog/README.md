# Writing a blog post

How to write, preview and publish a post on the site's blog ([plan 018](../../../plans/018-blog.md)). This guide stays in the repo; it is not a post and never appears on the site.

The example post, [`src/lib/blog/fixtures/2026-11-09-every-element.md`](../../src/lib/blog/fixtures/2026-11-09-every-element.md), uses every element below. It is also the blog's test post, so everything it shows is known to work. Copy from it.

## Files

- **The post:** one markdown file, `frontend/content/blog/<date>-<slug>.md`, starting with the post's `date` so the folder lists posts in order: `2026-11-09-why-cuts-are-not-everything.md`. The slug, the rest of the name, becomes the post's URL, `/blog/why-cuts-are-not-everything/`. Use lowercase words joined by hyphens. If the publishing day changes, rename the file along with `date`.
- **Its media** (images, videos, posters): `frontend/public/blog-media/<slug>/`, a folder named after the slug (no date). In the post, refer to them by file name only.

## Front matter

Every post starts with this block:

```markdown
---
title: Why scene cuts are only part of the story
date: 2026-11-09
tldr: Fast editing is the measure most people think of, but a video can feel intense with few cuts. This post shows three videos where cuts alone would get it wrong.
description: Why scene cuts alone don't tell you how stimulating a kids' video is, with three examples.
---
```

| Field | | |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | required | The post's heading, and its name in search results ("<title> - HyperStim?"). |
| `date` | required | `YYYY-MM-DD`. Posts are listed newest first. |
| `tldr` | required | Two or three sentences in the TL;DR box at the top, and under the title in the list. `**bold**` and `*italic*` work here; put the text in quotes if it starts with `*` or holds a `:` followed by a space. |
| `description` | optional | What search results and link previews show. Without it they show the TL;DR. **At most 155 characters**: if the TL;DR is longer, add a description (a test checks this). |

There is no author, reading time or draft field. A post that isn't ready stays on its branch (see **Publishing**).

## Text

Write in American English (color, center, gray), in short paragraphs. Standard markdown works: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, lists, `> quotes`, links and tables.

- **Headings:** `##` for sections and `###` inside them. The title is the page's only top heading, so `#` isn't allowed.
- **Links to the site's own pages** start with `/`: `[the rankings](/rankings/)`. Links to other sites open in a new tab.
- **Tables:** a header row, then `|---|---|`. Wide tables scroll sideways on phones.

## Figures

```markdown
::figure[The caption, shown under the image.]{src="cuts-chart.webp" alt="What the image shows, for someone who can't see it."}
```

- `alt` is required: describe what the image shows. The caption can add what it means.
- Figures are numbered for you ("Figure 1.", "Figure 2."). Write only the caption's text.

## Videos

Our own recording, played from the site:

```markdown
::video[The caption.]{src="compare-page.mp4" poster="compare-page.webp"}
```

A YouTube video, embedded:

```markdown
::youtube[The caption, also the video's name for screen readers.]{id="dQw4w9WgXcQ"}
```

- The `id` is the 11 characters after `watch?v=` in the video's link.
- Nothing loads from YouTube until the reader presses Play.
- Add the video's ID to `backend/data/blog-videos.txt`, so its thumbnail shows (the API serves thumbnails only for videos it knows; a test reminds you). Videos in a comparison below are added for you.
- Videos and YouTube embeds share one count ("Video 1.", "Video 2."), apart from figures.

### Comparing two videos

A clip comparison plays two YouTube videos side by side, with a tab per stretch (a verse, say). As a video plays, a chart under it fills in: a tick for each cut to a new shot, or a line for how much the picture moves. One video plays at a time.

```markdown
::::clips[The caption.]{a=enq9Ge90o1w b=jyaUWUFH3BA}
::cuts[Scene changes]{a=0:14.5-0:30.5 b=0:03-0:21.6}
::motion[Motion]{a=0:36-0:51.5 b=0:21.6-0:39.6}
::::
```

- `a` and `b` are the two videos' IDs. Each tab is `::cuts` or `::motion`, with its label and the stretch of each video as `minutes:seconds-minutes:seconds` (tenths allowed).
- One tab is fine; with two or more, readers switch between them.
- The numbers come from `public/blog-media/<slug>/clips.json`. Make it (and remake it after changing a block) with:

  ```sh
  cd backend
  uv run python scripts/clip_data.py <slug>
  ```

  It downloads only the stretches, to a temporary folder it deletes, and measures them as the dataset does. The build fails while a block and `clips.json` don't match. It also lists both videos in `backend/data/blog-videos.txt`, for their thumbnails.
- Check that both videos play when embedded: preview at `localhost` (not `127.0.0.1` or a server's IP address, where YouTube refuses some videos), and from another computer through an SSH tunnel (`ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 <server>`).
- It counts as a video ("Video 1.").

## References

Cite with a footnote: `[^key]` right after the words it supports, and the source anywhere in the file (the end is easiest):

```markdown
Studies of children's TV have looked at pacing this way for decades.[^pacing]

[^pacing]: Author, A., & Author, B. (2011). Title of the paper. *Journal Name*, 128(4), 644–649.
```

- Keys are any word you like; readers see numbers, `[1]`, `[2]`, in the order sources are first cited. Adding a citation never means renumbering.
- Each source is listed under **References** at the end, with a ↩ link back to the text.
- Cite the same source again with the same key.

## Media rules

- **Only our own material.** Images and figures come from the team. Videos are our own screen recordings, animations or talks. Never a clip downloaded from YouTube (the repo is public, `CLAUDE.md`): embed the YouTube video instead.
- **Images:** WebP or PNG, at most twice as wide as they show (the text column is at most about 1,100 px wide, so at most 2,200 px).
- **Videos:** MP4 (H.264), at most 10 MB each, always with a poster image (WebP or PNG, the video's first frame or a good still).
- **Alt text** on every figure, saying what it shows.

## Checks

The build fails, naming the post's file and the problem, when:

- `title`, `date` or `tldr` is missing, or the date isn't a real `YYYY-MM-DD` date;
- a media file the post refers to isn't in its folder;
- a figure has no `alt`, a video no `poster`, or a YouTube embed no valid `id`;
- a clip comparison lacks a caption, a tab or valid times, or doesn't match its `clips.json`;
- a file name doesn't start with the post's `date`;
- two posts have the same slug (also on different dates);
- a citation `[^key]` has no source, or a source is never cited;
- a heading is `#` or deeper than `###`, or an image is written with `![…](…)` instead of `::figure`.

## Preview

```sh
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/blog/. The page updates as you save. A broken post shows the build's error in the browser.

## Social video

A post can have a short film for X and LinkedIn: its clip comparison played as a 1920 × 1080 video (plan 018, Social video). It isn't shown on the site. Its files live in a folder named like the post, next to it, which the blog never reads as a post: `content/blog/<date>-<slug>/`.

- `social-video.md`: the verses each video plays, as a `::::clips` block (a `cuts` tab, then a `motion` tab).
- `social-video.json`: the measured verses. After changing a verse, run `uv run python scripts/social_video_data.py ../frontend/content/blog/<date>-<slug>` in `backend/`.
- `social-video.html`: the film, drawn like the post's widget.

Watch it, then render it:

```sh
cd frontend
node scripts/social-video.mjs content/blog/<date>-<slug> --serve   # prints an address to open
node scripts/social-video.mjs content/blog/<date>-<slug>           # writes social-video.mp4 there
```

Both download the verses' stretches into a temporary folder first and delete them afterwards (they need the network, `uv` and ffmpeg). Rendering records every frame and takes about six minutes for a one-minute film. `--clips DIR` reuses clips downloaded before (see the script's header). The MP4 holds the channels' footage, so it's never committed (`.gitignore`); post it by hand.

## Publishing

1. Write the post on the blog's branch, `018-blog`, rebased onto `main` first (`DEVELOPMENT.md`). It stays there, unpublished, until it's merged.
2. Commit the post and its media together, as `feat: Add the blog post "<title>" (plan 018)`. It's new text visitors can read, so it gets a release note.
3. Merge it into `main` as for any change (lint, type check, tests and build pass first).
4. It goes live with the next release (`hyperstim-release`, run by the team).
