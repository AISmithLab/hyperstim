# Project rules

Website for the HyperStimulation project: a Next.js frontend (static, GitHub Pages) and a Python backend (runs on our own server, serves the frontend's API requests).

## Workflow

- Work is iterative. For each request: write a plan in `plans/`, wait for review, then implement only the parts that were approved.
- Plans are concise: goal, decisions, steps, open questions. No long prose.
- Plan files are numbered: `plans/NNN-short-title.md` (e.g. `001-architecture.md`). Never rewrite an approved plan to change its decisions; write a new plan instead.
- Later plans override earlier ones. If a new plan contradicts an earlier one and it is unclear whether that is intended, ask before proceeding.
- Keep this file up to date when a rule changes.

## Public repository

This repo is public. Never commit:

- Secrets, tokens, cookies, API keys, or `.env` files (commit `.env.example` with placeholder values only).
- Server details: hostnames, IPs, ports, usernames, absolute paths on the server, systemd/nginx files with real values. Use env vars and placeholders.
- Research data that is not cleared for release (raw datasets, private pipeline code, unpublished results). The backend reads these from paths given in its config.
- Downloaded video clips. They are also never served by the backend; the site exposes only video IDs, public metadata, and scores.
- Notes about third-party sites used as design inspiration. Describe design intent in our own words only.

Before committing, check `git diff --staged` for anything above.

## Engineering

- Production quality, but keep it simple and maintainable. Prefer few dependencies and boring, well-known tools. No abstraction until there are two real uses for it.
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, static export), Tailwind CSS. No server-side features (no API routes, no SSR, no image optimization).
- Backend: Python, FastAPI. Config only through environment variables.
- The frontend talks to the backend only through the typed API client in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`; the backend's API contract lives in `backend/` and both change together.
- Accessibility and mobile layouts are requirements, not polish.
- Each change must pass lint, type check, build, and tests before commit.
- Commit messages: imperative, describe the why. Do not commit or push unless asked.
